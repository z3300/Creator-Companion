This project uses NLP to transcribe and process over 200 episodes of "The Colin and Samir Show" using OpenAI's Whisper and text-embedding-ada-002 model. The processed data is stored in Pinecone for fast querying using Langchain and GPT-4, which generate responses to user queries. This project showcases the power of NLP technologies to efficiently and accurately process and query large volumes of natural language data.
