This project utilizes OpenAI's Whisper to transcribe over 200 episodes of "The Colin and Samir Show" and then processes the transcripts using natural language processing techniques. The processed data is stored in Pinecone, a vector database, and queried using Langchain and GPT-4 to generate responses to user queries about the show's content.
